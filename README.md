### **Business Management System**

A robust **Spring Boot** backend application to manage business accounts, contacts, products, and sales orders with auto-generated IDs, soft deletion, and tax calculations.

---

##  Overview

This backend project provides a complete solution for business management, including modules for:

- **Account Management**
- **Contact Management**
- **Product Management (with Soft Delete)**
- **Sales Order Management (with Soft Delete)**

It supports secure REST APIs, JWT authentication, pagination, and historical data retention with soft delete.

---

##  Core Modules

###  1. Account Management
- Full CRUD operations for business accounts.  
- Auto-generate unique account numbers (`ACC-1001`, `ACC-1002`, ‚Ä¶).  
- Search accounts by name with pagination and sorting.

###  2. Contact Management
- CRUD operations for contacts linked to accounts.  
- Maintain **one-to-many relationship** between accounts and contacts.  
- Validation and data integrity ensured.

###  3. Product Management (Soft Delete)
- Create, update, and delete products.  
- Auto-generate product codes (`PRD-1001`, `PRD-1002`, ‚Ä¶).  
- Implements **soft delete**: deleted products are inactive and cannot be used in new orders.  
- Only active products are listed and available.

###  4. Sales Order Management (Soft Delete)
- Create sales orders with multiple products.  
- Auto-generate order numbers (`SO-YYYYMMDD-0001`).  
- Calculates:
  - **Subtotal** (sum of item prices √ó quantities)  
  - **Tax (18%)**  
  - **Total amount (subtotal + tax)**
- Only **customers** can create and cancel their own orders.  
- Cancelled orders are **soft deleted**, not removed from the database.

##  API Endpoints

| Module       | Endpoint            | Description                     |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Account      | `/api/accounts`     | Manage account CRUD operations  |
| Contact      | `/api/contacts`     | Manage contacts for accounts    |
| Product      | `/api/products`     | CRUD + Soft delete for products |
| Sales Orders | `/api/sales-orders` | Create, view, and cancel orders |

üîπ All APIs support **pagination**, **sorting**, and **soft delete filtering**.

Business Logic Highlights

Auto-generated IDs for all major entities.

Soft delete implemented using an isActive flag.

18% Tax Calculation for all sales orders.

Role-based access ensuring only customers can create/cancel orders.

Historical data preservation through soft delete.

Example Order Calculation
{
  "subtotal": 2776.0,
  "tax": 277.6,
  "total": 3053.6
}


System applies 18% tax automatically.

##  Monitoring with Actuator

Spring Boot Actuator provides health and metrics endpoints:

| Endpoint            | Description               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `/actuator/health`  | Application health status |
| `/actuator/info`    | Basic app info            |
| `/actuator/metrics` | Performance metrics       |

##  Developer Notes

* Use `@Valid` for DTO validation
* `@Max`, `@Min`, and `@NotNull` annotations for input rules
* Soft delete implemented using `isActive` boolean field
* Exception handling via `@ControllerAdvice`

## Summary
The Business Management System backend is a scalable, modular, and secure Spring Boot application designed to simplify business workflows ‚Äî from managing accounts to processing sales orders with automated tax, validation, and soft delete mechanisms.
