##  Core Modules

### üè¢ Account Management
- Perform full CRUD operations on business accounts.  
- Auto-generate unique account numbers (`ACC-1001`, `ACC-1002`, ...).  
- Search accounts by name with **pagination** and sorting.  

### Contact Management
- Manage contacts (employees/students) linked to accounts.  
- Maintain one-to-many relationships between accounts and contacts.  
- Full CRUD functionality with validation.

###  Product Management (Soft Delete)
- Create, update, and delete products.  
- Auto-generate product codes (`PRD-1001`, `PRD-1002`, ...).  
- Implements **soft delete**: deleted products are inactive and cannot be used in new orders.  

###  Sales Order Management (Soft Delete)
- Create sales orders containing multiple products.  
- Auto-generate order numbers (`SO-YYYYMMDD-0001`).  
- Calculates:
  - **Subtotal** (sum of item prices √ó quantities)
  - **Tax (18%)**
  - **Total amount (subtotal + tax)**
- Only **customers** can create or cancel their own orders.  
- Soft delete for orders ‚Äî cancelled orders remain in the database but marked inactive.
